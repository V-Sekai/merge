merge groups-staging-4.4 remotes/YeldhamDev/out_all_of_you # In large scenes (and especially in the remote tree), showing nodes that match the filter with parents that do not can be annoying if multiple results are from different hierarchies, as this creates unnecessary pollution. This PR adds a toggle in the menu of the "SceneTree" dock to hide those parents, purely showing only matched nodes.
